# WCSearchAPIMARCHarvester
The WCSearchAPIMARCHarvester is a little Python script that uses the <a href= "http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests library</a> with the <a href="https://www.oclc.org/developer/develop/web-services/worldcat-search-api.en.html">OCLC WorldCat Search API</a> to query OCLC master records and download MARC records that match the query. For folks like me at libraries using WorldCat Discovery, you can then transform these records into a KBART file, upload it to collection manager to create a new KB collection or enhance the metadata of an existing collection.
